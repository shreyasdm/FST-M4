
Activity 1

---In this activity, we will be creating files in the local filesystem and the copying it into the HDFS.


---Create a text file named txtFile.txt and add the following text to it:

vim txtFile.txt

---Create a CSV file named csvFile.csv and add the following data to it:
vim csvFile.csv


--check file is there or not
ls

---Next, create a directory named textData in the HDFS.
 hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/root/textData

---Copy the CSV file, csvFile.csv, into the textData folder in the HDFS.
hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal ./csvFile.csv /user/root/textData

---Create a blank File
 hdfs dfs -touchz /user/root/textData/textfile.txt

---Create a file in the textData folder named textFile.txt 
hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal ./txtFile.txt /user/root/textData/txtFile.txt


--- copy the contents of the txtFile.txt in the local system into the textFile.txt.
hdfs dfs -getmerge -nl /user/root/textData/txtFile.txt /user/root/textData/textfile.txt /user/root/textData/textfile.txt


---Check the copy is complete
root@6b634194146b:/# hdfs dfs -cat /user/root/textData/txtFile.txt
Night. That over years creepeth green fourth had after also seas make. Female living sea very hath. Dry good in is bring fifth under creeping all tree land.


---Check the final copy complete
root@6b634194146b:/# hdfs dfs -cat /user/root/textData/textFile.txt
Night. That over years creepeth green fourth had after also seas make. Female living sea very hath. Dry good in is bring fifth under creeping all tree land.

---Finally use the stat command to get the file statistics:
root@6b634194146b:/# hdfs dfs -stat "type:%F permissions:%a %u:%g size:%b name:%n" /user/root/textData/textFile.txt
type:regular file permissions:644 root:supergroup size:157 name:textFile.txt
